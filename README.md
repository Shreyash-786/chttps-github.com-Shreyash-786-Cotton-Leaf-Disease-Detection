# ðŸŒ¿ Cotton Leaf Disease Detection

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect diseases in cotton leaves from images. It helps farmers and researchers quickly identify infected leaves and take appropriate action.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Image classification using CNN
- Detects three classes:
  - Healthy
  - Curl Virus
  - Other Infections
- GUI-based interface using Python's Tkinter
- Accuracy above 90% on validation dataset

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ–¼ Dataset

The model is trained on a labeled dataset of cotton leaf images containing:
- **Healthy leaves**
- **Leaves infected with curl virus**
- **Other types of infections**

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
